However, some states allow for those with two-year degrees in accounting or business administration to sit for the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exam. The CPA exam is a rigorous, three-part test that verifies an accountant’s knowledge of accounting principles and practice.\n\nIn order to be a licensed CPA, an accountant must complete 150 hours of continuing professional education (CPE) every three years. This requirement ensures that accountants are up-to-date on the latest changes in accounting standards and practices.

It can be difficult to keep track of all the different financial transactions and paperwork, and ensure that everything is filed correctly.
