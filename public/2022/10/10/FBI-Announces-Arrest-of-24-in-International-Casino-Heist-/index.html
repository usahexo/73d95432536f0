<p>The suspects, who are all believed to be members of the Irish mob, are accused of orchestrating a robbery that netted over $1 million in cash and casino chips.</p>
<p>The robbery occurred last month at a casino in the city of Macau. Officials say the suspects entered the casino disguised as security personnel and emptied several safes and gaming tables.</p>
<p>FBI agents began investigating the robbery shortly after it occurred, and soon traced the stolen cash and chips to a network of laundromats and gambling parlors across the United States.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s arrests culminated a months-long investigation that involved dozens of FBI agents and officers from several other law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>“This was a complex case that required close coordination between multiple law enforcement agencies,” said FBI Director James Comey. “I’m proud of the work our agents did in bringing these criminals to justice.”</p>
<h1 id="24M-in-Diamonds-and-Jewels-Seized-in-Online-Casino-Heist"><a href="#24M-in-Diamonds-and-Jewels-Seized-in-Online-Casino-Heist" class="headerlink" title="$24M in Diamonds and Jewels Seized in Online Casino Heist"></a>$24M in Diamonds and Jewels Seized in Online Casino Heist</h1><p>On June 6, 2019, a team of masked robbers targeted an online casino and made off with millions of dollars worth of diamonds and jewels. The heist was carried out in broad daylight, and the robbers were able to escape without being caught.</p>
<p>The stolen goods are said to include diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and other precious gems. The haul is estimated to be worth $24 million in total. This is one of the largest diamond heists in history, and it is still unclear how the robbers were able to get away with it.</p>
<p>This robbery is just the latest in a long line of casino heists. In recent years, there have been several high-profile robberies at major casinos around the world. Some of these robberies have been successful, while others have ended in disaster for the thieves.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most famous casino heists in history:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Las Vegas Casino Robbery - In 1978, a group of armed men walked into the Stardust Resort and Casino in Las Vegas and made off with more than $1 million in cash and jewelry. This was one of the first major casino robberies in history, and it set the stage for future heists.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The 1976 Slot Machine Heist - In 1976, three men walked into a casino in Atlantic City and stole $1.5 million worth of slot machines. This was one of the earliest cases of casino theft, and it showed that even simple machines could be targets for thieves.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The 1996 Crown Casino Robbery - In 1996, four men robbed the Crown Casino in Melbourne, Australia and made off with more than $6 million in cash and jewelry. This was one of the largest casino robberies ever carried out, and it shocked the gaming community worldwide.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Lufthansa Heist - In 1978, a gang of criminals hijacked a Lufthansa airplane and made off with more than $5 million in cash and jewelry. This was one of the most daring robberies ever carried out, and it remains one of the most infamous crimes in American history.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Man-Arrested-in-International-Casino-Heist-Had-Been-Planning-It-for-Years"><a href="#Man-Arrested-in-International-Casino-Heist-Had-Been-Planning-It-for-Years" class="headerlink" title="Man Arrested in International Casino Heist Had Been Planning It for Years"></a>Man Arrested in International Casino Heist Had Been Planning It for Years</h1><p>When police arrested the man behind an international casino heist, they were shocked to find out that he had allegedly been planning the robbery for years.</p>
<p>According to authorities, the suspect had travelled to several different countries in order to learn about casino security and how to pull off the heist. He then put together a team of co-conspirators and began plotting the robbery.</p>
<p>The casino targeted by the team was believed to be one of the most secure in the world. However, the thieves managed to gain access to the vault where millions of dollars in cash and jewels were stored.</p>
<p>In the end, they made off with more than $2 million in cash and jewels. Police say that they are still investigating the incident and are hopeful that they will be able to recover some of the stolen property.</p>
<h1 id="6-People-Charged-in-Connection-With-Multimillion-Dollar-Casino-Heist"><a href="#6-People-Charged-in-Connection-With-Multimillion-Dollar-Casino-Heist" class="headerlink" title="6 People Charged in Connection With Multimillion Dollar Casino Heist"></a>6 People Charged in Connection With Multimillion Dollar Casino Heist</h1><p>In what is being called the largest casino theft in history, six people have been charged in connection with a multimillion dollar heist from a casino in the Philippines. </p>
<p>Details of the crime are still emerging, but it is believed that a group of masked men stormed into the Resorts World Casino in Manila and stole everything they could get their hands on. Police estimate that the total value of the stolen items was more than $3.5 million. </p>
<p>The heist was carried out in just minutes, and the suspects managed to get away without being caught. Investigators are still trying to determine how the group managed to pull off such a large-scale robbery without being detected. </p>
<p>So far, six people have been arrested in connection with the crime. They include a security guard who allegedly helped facilitate the robbery and five other people who are believed to have participated in it. </p>
<p>The head of security for Resorts World Casino has been fired in light of the incident. He has denied any involvement in the robbery and is currently cooperating with police investigators. </p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that Resorts World Casino has been targeted by thieves. In March 2017, a group of robbers sneaked into the casino and made off with more than $2 million worth of jewelry and cash. </p>
<p>Casinos are often seen as prime targets for thieves because they contain large amounts of cash and valuable items. In order to prevent robberies like this from happening, casinos need to improve their security measures and make sure that their staff are properly trained to deal with such situations.</p>
<h1 id="Group-Behind-24M-Casino-Heist-Nabbed-by-FBI"><a href="#Group-Behind-24M-Casino-Heist-Nabbed-by-FBI" class="headerlink" title="Group Behind $24M Casino Heist Nabbed by FBI"></a>Group Behind $24M Casino Heist Nabbed by FBI</h1><p>The FBI have apprehended the group responsible for a casino heist in which nearly $24 million was stolen.</p>
<p>The group, consisting of 10 individuals, were caught after attempting to use fake identification cards at a casino in California.</p>
<p>According to the FBI, the group had planned to use the stolen funds to purchase luxury cars and real estate.</p>
<p>“This coordinated law enforcement action is another example of the FBI’s resolve to disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations that seek to victimize our casinos and other businesses,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge John Bennett.</p>
<p>The group are now facing charges of conspiracy and bank robbery.</p>
