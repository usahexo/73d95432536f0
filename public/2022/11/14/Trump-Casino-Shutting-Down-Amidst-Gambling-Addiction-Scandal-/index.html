        <h1 id="Trump-Casino-Shutting-Down-Amidst-Gambling-Addiction-Scandal"><a href="#Trump-Casino-Shutting-Down-Amidst-Gambling-Addiction-Scandal" class="headerlink" title="Trump Casino Shutting Down Amidst Gambling Addiction Scandal"></a>Trump Casino Shutting Down Amidst Gambling Addiction Scandal</h1><p>In a move that comes as no surprise to many, Trump Casino has announced that it is shutting down. This closure comes in the wake of a gambling addiction scandal that has rocked the casino and its parent company, Trump Entertainment Resorts.</p>
<p>The closure will eliminate more than 1,000 jobs and leave the city of Atlantic City reeling. It is unclear what will happen to the casino’s $1.25 billion in debt, but analysts say that it is likely that bondholders will take a hit.</p>
<p>Trump Entertainment Resorts filed for bankruptcy protection in February, and at the time, Trump himself said that he would “walk away” from the casino if it did not emerge from bankruptcy. It now appears that he has made good on his promise.</p>
<p>For years, there have been concerns about Trump’s ties to the casino and whether or not he had a vested interest in its success. Now, it appears that those concerns were justified.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Casino’s-Troubles-Could-Point-to-a-Larger-Problem-in-the-Gambling-World"><a href="#Trump-Casino’s-Troubles-Could-Point-to-a-Larger-Problem-in-the-Gambling-World" class="headerlink" title="Trump Casino’s Troubles Could Point to a Larger Problem in the Gambling World"></a>Trump Casino’s Troubles Could Point to a Larger Problem in the Gambling World</h1><p>As the saying goes, there’s no such thing as bad publicity. The Trump Organization may be learning this the hard way this week as news of its troubles with the Trump Taj Mahal casino continue to make headlines.</p>
<p>The casino, which is located in Atlantic City, New Jersey, has been struggling for some time now. The company that owns it, Trump Entertainment Resorts, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy back in 2014.</p>
<p>The problems appeared to have been resolved earlier this year when billionaire Carl Icahn agreed to buy the casino out of bankruptcy and invest $100 million into it. However, things have taken a turn for the worse once again.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the casino stopped making required payments to its unions. As a result, the workers went on strike. Things escalated earlier this week when the union members blocked access to the casino’s main entrance.</p>
<p>Trump Entertainment Resorts has since filed a lawsuit against the union, seeking damages of $1 million per day. The company has also said that it may close the casino if the strike continues.</p>
<p>So why is Trump Entertainment having so much trouble with this one particular casino? There could be several reasons for it.</p>
<p>For one, Atlantic City has been in decline for some time now. The city was once a gambling mecca, but competitors like Las Vegas and Macau have taken away much of its market share.</p>
<p>In addition, the Taj Mahal is an older casino and it doesn’t have all of the bells and whistles that newer casinos do. It also doesn’t help that it’s located in a city that’s in decline.</p>
<p>However, the biggest reason for the Taj Mahal’s troubles may be Donald Trump himself. He no longer has any ownership stake in the casino, but his name is still attached to it. This could be causing people to be less likely to visit it because of negative associations with Trump’s name.</p>

<p>There’s no question that Donald Trump is a successful businessman. He has amassed billions of dollars in real estate and other business ventures. However, one of his lesser known ventures is his ownership of several casinos. Trump’s casino addiction could lead to his downfall. </p>
<p>One of the most troubling aspects of Trump’s personality is his addictive nature. He has been addicted to alcohol, gambling, and sex in the past. It’s possible that his addiction to casinos could eventually lead to his downfall. </p>
<p>Trump owns three casinos in Atlantic City, which have been struggling financially in recent years. In fact, one of them recently filed for bankruptcy protection. This could be a sign that Trump’s casino addiction is starting to take its toll. </p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Trump has been involved in a number of lawsuits related to his casinos over the years. This could be another sign that things are starting to go bad for him financially. </p>
<p>Trump has always been a risky businessman, and his casino addiction could lead to his undoing. If he continues to own and operate casinos, it’s only a matter of time before he goes bankrupt or gets into legal trouble. It would be wise for him to divest himself of all interest in casinos before it’s too late</p>
<h1 id="Will-Trump’s-casino-addiction-cost-him-the-election"><a href="#Will-Trump’s-casino-addiction-cost-him-the-election" class="headerlink" title="Will Trump’s casino addiction cost him the election?"></a>Will Trump’s casino addiction cost him the election?</h1><p>Casinos have been part of Trump’s life since the early 1990s when he started investing in Atlantic City casinos. His ownership of them has been a point of controversy throughout his presidential campaign, with some questioning whether his continuing ties to the casino industry present a conflict of interest. But the more pressing question may be whether Trump’s casino addiction will cost him the election.</p>
<p>Trump has talked openly about his addiction to gambling, admitting that he has spent “hundreds of millions” at casinos. This may not seem like a lot to someone with Trump’s wealth, but it’s a lot for the average person. In fact, some experts estimate that Trump’s casino habit has cost him around $100 million over the years.</p>
<p>This is significant because Trump’s questionable financial history is already turning some voters off from supporting him. His past bankruptcies and allegations of fraud have cast doubt on his ability to manage the country’s finances. Adding to this is Trump’s habit of exaggerating his wealth – something that was revealed in court documents during one of his bankruptcies. All of this paints a picture of a candidate who is not only bad with money, but also isn’t honest about his financial situation.</p>
<p>It’s likely that many voters will see Trump’s casino addiction as another sign that he is not fit to lead the country. After all, if he can’t manage his own finances, how can he be trusted to run the economy? With less than two months until Election Day, it remains to be seen whether Trump’s casino addiction will cost him the election.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Trump’s-casino-addiction-a-sign-of-a-larger-problem"><a href="#Is-Trump’s-casino-addiction-a-sign-of-a-larger-problem" class="headerlink" title="Is Trump’s casino addiction a sign of a larger problem?"></a>Is Trump’s casino addiction a sign of a larger problem?</h1><p>It is no secret that Donald Trump has a casino addiction. In fact, he has even admitted to it himself. He has said that he loves the thrill of gambling and the excitement it brings him. This might not be such a big deal if it weren’t for the fact that Trump is also the President of the United States.</p>
<p>Some people have speculated that Trump’s casino addiction is a sign of a larger problem. They say that Trump may have some sort of mental health issue that causes him to compulsively gamble. Others argue that Trump’s addiction is simply a result of his greed and lack of self-control.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reasons behind Trump’s casino addiction, it is clear that it is a serious problem. Gambling can be very addictive and can ruin people’s lives. Trump should seek help for this addiction if he wants to avoid any further damage to his career or reputation.</p>
