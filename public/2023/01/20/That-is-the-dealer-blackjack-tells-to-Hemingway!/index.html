One such tell was to look for players who would lick their cards. Apparently, this was due to the oils on the players’ tongues which would help them to grip the cards better. </p>
<p>Dealers soon learned that this was not a reliable tell and that many legitimate players also licked their cards. In fact, one of the most famous blackjack players of all time, Ernest Hemingway, reportedly licked his cards as part of his strategy.</p>
<p>Today, card counting is still used by blackjack players, and while licking your cards is no longer considered a tell, it can still help you grip the cards better. So if you’re looking for an edge in this popular casino game, be sure to give licking your cards a try!</p>

Called the [[Hemingway Method]], it enables players to detect when the dealer is using specific tells that give away their hand.</p>
<p> Brian’s article on the subject has since gone viral, with commentators and blackjack enthusiasts around the world weighing in with their thoughts. Some have hailed it as a life-changing revelation while others claim that the method is nothing new and simply relies on statistical probability.</p>
<p>Regardless of which side of the debate you fall on, one thing is for sure - the Hemingway Method is definitely generating a lot of interest in blackjack circles. So much so that Brian has even announced plans to release an online tutorial video next week that will teach people how to use the Hemingway Method themselves!</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you’re keen to try out this hot new blackjack strategy for yourself, be sure to check out Brian’s original article on the Hemingway Method HERE.</p>

<h1 id="Uncover-the-dealer-blackjack-tells-that-made-Hemingway-a-legend"><a href="#Uncover-the-dealer-blackjack-tells-that-made-Hemingway-a-legend" class="headerlink" title="Uncover the dealer blackjack tells that made Hemingway a legend!"></a>Uncover the dealer blackjack tells that made Hemingway a legend!</h1><p>The charms of blackjack are many. The mix of skill and chance, the focus and intensity, the endless variety of ways to play all make it one of the most popular casino games in the world.</p>
<p>One key reason for blackjack’s enduring popularity is that it is a game that can be beaten. And for those who are prepared to put in the time and effort required, blackjack can be a very profitable endeavour.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein was reputed to have said: “Blackjack is not a difficult game to beat if you apply some basic mathematics.” This is certainly true, but beating blackjack also takes considerable skill and experience. The best players are able to read other players and the dealer, and use this information to make informed betting decisions.</p>
<p>One of the greatest blackjack players of all time was Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway was so successful at blackjack that he was able to support himself and his family from his winnings at the casino tables. So how did Hemingway do it? What were his secrets?</p>
<p>In truth, Hemingway was a master of virtually all forms of gambling, but he was particularly adept at blackjack. He recognised that blackjack is not just a game of chance, but that there is also a large element of skill involved. He also understood that successful play requires an ability to read other players and the dealer.</p>
<p>Hemingway’s main weapon in blackjack was his ability to spot dealer tells. Dealer tells are subtle signals from the dealer that give away information about their hand. Hemingway would watch the dealer closely for any clues about what they were holding, and then use this information to make informed betting decisions.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common dealer tells:</p>
<ul>
<li>When dealers take cards off the top of the deck, they will often reveal whether they have a good or bad hand. A good hand means they are likely to bust (go over 21), while a bad hand means they are likely to hit (take another card). Hemingway would look out for these signals and use them to determine when it was safe to bet big and when he should hold back. </li>
<li>Dealers will sometimes show their cards when they exchange them with other players - usually by placing them face down on the table in front of them. Hemingway would watch for this tell as it would give him an idea as to whether the dealer had a good or bad hand. </li>
<li>Dealers will often ‘pick up’ their cards (take them off the table) when they have a strong hand such as an ace or king. Hemingway would look out for this tell as it would indicate that the dealer was likely holding a good hand. </li>
<li>When dealers slide their cards across the table (usually towards themselves), it can indicate that they have weak hands (pairs or below). Hemingway would use this tell to determine when it was safe to bet big money on high cards. </li>
<li>Dealers often tap their fingers on the table when they have strong hands - usually pairs of 8s or higher. Hemingway would watch for this tell as it would indicate that he had an advantage over the house - something which he always looked for!</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Learn-the-secrets-of-the-dealer-blackjack-tells-Hemingway-used-to-beat-the-house"><a href="#Learn-the-secrets-of-the-dealer-blackjack-tells-Hemingway-used-to-beat-the-house" class="headerlink" title="Learn the secrets of the dealer blackjack tells Hemingway used to beat the house!"></a>Learn the secrets of the dealer blackjack tells Hemingway used to beat the house!</h1><p>Would you like to learn how to beat the casino at blackjack? It may not be as difficult as you think. Even if you don’t have a Einstein-level intellect, there are some simple tells that the dealer gives off which can reveal their hole card.</p>
<p>Hemmingway was a well-known blackjack player and he was known for using these tells to his advantage. If you can learn to read them, too, then you can increase your chances of walking away from the table with more money in your pocket.</p>
<p>To start off, let’s take a look at the most common dealer tells:</p>
<p>● The dealer looks down at the cards in their hand - This is generally a sign that they have a good hand. They are likely trying to judge what they should do next.</p>
<p>● The dealer holds up their cards close to their body - Again, this is generally a sign that they have a good hand and are trying not to give anything away.</p>
<p>● The dealer scratches their head or adjusts their glasses - This is usually a sign that they are considering whether or not to hit on 16 or stay pat with a 7. If they are scratching their head, it usually means that they are unsure and may hit even if they shouldn’t. If they adjust their glasses, it usually means that they are going to stay pat.</p>
<p>● The dealer pulls out new cards - Generally speaking, if the dealer is pulling out new cards, it means that they are changing up their strategy and may be weaker than usual.</p>
<p>Now that we know what some of the most common dealer tells are, let’s go over how Hemingway used them to his advantage:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Look for dealers who constantly glance down at their cards - Hemingway found that dealers who constantly glanced down at their cards were likely holding a strong hand. If he had a low hand himself, he would often fold rather than risk losing more money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Watch out for dealers who hold up their cards close to their body - Hemingway knew that these dealers were likely trying to conceal a good hand. If he had a good hand himself, he would take this opportunity to make a larger bet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep an eye out for dealers who scratch their heads or adjust their glasses - As we mentioned earlier, these actions usually mean that the dealer is considering whether or not to hit on 16 or stay pat with a 7. Hemingway would use this information to help him make better decisions about his own hand. For example, if the dealer was scratching her head but Hemingway already had 18 points showing, he would know that it was safe to bet big since the dealer was likely going to bust!</p>
</li>
</ol>
