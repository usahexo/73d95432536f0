<p>Yang Wei said he got the idea for the lounge after spending many hours playing video games with his friends and family.</p>
<p>“I love video games, but I don’t always have time to play them at home,” he said. “So I thought it would be great to have a place where I could go and play them with my friends. And I figured other people would want to do the same thing, so I decided to open up the lounge.”</p>
<p>The lounge has been busy since it opened earlier this week, with people of all ages coming in to play games. Some are trying out new games they’ve never played before while others are revisiting old favourites.</p>
<p>Yang Wei said he plans to keep adding new games to the lounge as they become available, so there will always be something new for gamers to try out. He also plans to hold tournaments and other special events in the future.</p>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <h1 id="Trump-Casino-Shutting-Down-Amidst-Gambling-Addiction-Scandal"><a href="#Trump-Casino-Shutting-Down-Amidst-Gambling-Addiction-Scandal" class="headerlink" title="Trump Casino Shutting Down Amidst Gambling Addiction Scandal"></a>Trump Casino Shutting Down Amidst Gambling Addiction Scandal</h1><p>In a move that comes as no surprise to many, Trump Casino has announced that it is shutting down. This closure comes in the wake of a gambling addiction scandal that has rocked the casino and its parent company, Trump Entertainment Resorts.</p>
<p>The closure will eliminate more than 1,000 jobs and leave the city of Atlantic City reeling. It is unclear what will happen to the casino’s $1.25 billion in debt, but analysts say that it is likely that bondholders will take a hit.</p>
<p>Trump Entertainment Resorts filed for bankruptcy protection in February, and at the time, Trump himself said that he would “walk away” from the casino if it did not emerge from bankruptcy. It now appears that he has made good on his promise.</p>
<p>For years, there have been concerns about Trump’s ties to the casino and whether or not he had a vested interest in its success. Now, it appears that those concerns were justified.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Casino’s-Troubles-Could-Point-to-a-Larger-Problem-in-the-Gambling-World"><a href="#Trump-Casino’s-Troubles-Could-Point-to-a-Larger-Problem-in-the-Gambling-World" class="headerlink" title="Trump Casino’s Troubles Could Point to a Larger Problem in the Gambling World"></a>Trump Casino’s Troubles Could Point to a Larger Problem in the Gambling World</h1><p>As the saying goes, there’s no such thing as bad publicity. The Trump Organization may be learning this the hard way this week as news of its troubles with the Trump Taj Mahal casino continue to make headlines.</p>
<p>The casino, which is located in Atlantic City, New Jersey, has been struggling for some time now. The company that owns it, Trump Entertainment Resorts, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy back in 2014.</p>
<p>The problems appeared to have been resolved earlier this year when billionaire Carl Icahn agreed to buy the casino out of bankruptcy and invest $100 million into it. However, things have taken a turn for the worse once again.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the casino stopped making required payments to its unions. As a result, the workers went on strike. Things escalated earlier this week when the union members blocked access to the casino’s main entrance.</p>
<p>Trump Entertainment Resorts has since filed a lawsuit against the union, seeking damages of $1 million per day. The company has also said that it may close the casino if the strike continues.</p>
<p>So why is Trump Entertainment having so much trouble with this one particular casino? There could be several reasons for it.</p>
<p>For one, Atlantic City has been in decline for some time now. The city was once a gambling mecca, but competitors like Las Vegas and Macau have taken away much of its market share.</p>
<p>In addition, the Taj Mahal is an older casino and it doesn’t have all of the bells and whistles that newer casinos do. It also doesn’t help that it’s located in a city that’s in decline.</p>
<p>However, the biggest reason for the Taj Mahal’s troubles may be Donald Trump himself. He no longer has any ownership stake in the casino, but his name is still attached to it. This could be causing people to be less likely to visit it because of negative associations with Trump’s name.</p>
<h1 id="How-Trump’s-Casino-addiction-could-lead-to-his-downfall"><a href="#How-Trump’s-Casino-addiction-could-lead-to-his-downfall" class="headerlink" title="How Trump’s Casino addiction could lead to his downfall"></a>How Trump’s Casino addiction could lead to his downfall</h1> <div align="center">

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1488161949638-d877a5b9c7f8?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=faces&auto=webp&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9PSJ9&s=1" width="800" height="600">

</div>

<p>There’s no question that Donald Trump is a successful businessman. He has amassed billions of dollars in real estate and other business ventures. However, one of his lesser known ventures is his ownership of several casinos. Trump’s casino addiction could lead to his downfall. </p>
<p>One of the most troubling aspects of Trump’s personality is his addictive nature. He has been addicted to alcohol, gambling, and sex in the past. It’s possible that his addiction to casinos could eventually lead to his downfall. </p>
<p>Trump owns three casinos in Atlantic City, which have been struggling financially in recent years. In fact, one of them recently filed for bankruptcy protection. This could be a sign that Trump’s casino addiction is starting to take its toll. </p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Trump has been involved in a number of lawsuits related to his casinos over the years. This could be another sign that things are starting to go bad for him financially. </p>
<p>Trump has always been a risky businessman, and his casino addiction could lead to his undoing. If he continues to own and operate casinos, it’s only a matter of time before he goes bankrupt or gets into legal trouble. It would be wise for him to divest himself of all interest in casinos before it’s too late</p>
<h1 id="Will-Trump’s-casino-addiction-cost-him-the-election"><a href="#Will-Trump’s-casino-addiction-cost-him-the-election" class="headerlink" title="Will Trump’s casino addiction cost him the election?"></a>Will Trump’s casino addiction cost him the election?</h1><p>Casinos have been part of Trump’s life since the early 1990s when he started investing in Atlantic City casinos. His ownership of them has been a point of controversy throughout his presidential campaign, with some questioning whether his continuing ties to the casino industry present a conflict of interest. But the more pressing question may be whether Trump’s casino addiction will cost him the election.</p>
<p>Trump has talked openly about his addiction to gambling, admitting that he has spent “hundreds of millions” at casinos. This may not seem like a lot to someone with Trump’s wealth, but it’s a lot for the average person. In fact, some experts estimate that Trump’s casino habit has cost him around $100 million over the years.</p>
<p>This is significant because Trump’s questionable financial history is already turning some voters off from supporting him. His past bankruptcies and allegations of fraud have cast doubt on his ability to manage the country’s finances. Adding to this is Trump’s habit of exaggerating his wealth – something that was revealed in court documents during one of his bankruptcies. All of this paints a picture of a candidate who is not only bad with money, but also isn’t honest about his financial situation.</p>
<p>It’s likely that many voters will see Trump’s casino addiction as another sign that he is not fit to lead the country. After all, if he can’t manage his own finances, how can he be trusted to run the economy? With less than two months until Election Day, it remains to be seen whether Trump’s casino addiction will cost him the election.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Trump’s-casino-addiction-a-sign-of-a-larger-problem"><a href="#Is-Trump’s-casino-addiction-a-sign-of-a-larger-problem" class="headerlink" title="Is Trump’s casino addiction a sign of a larger problem?"></a>Is Trump’s casino addiction a sign of a larger problem?</h1><p>It is no secret that Donald Trump has a casino addiction. In fact, he has even admitted to it himself. He has said that he loves the thrill of gambling and the excitement it brings him. This might not be such a big deal if it weren’t for the fact that Trump is also the President of the United States.</p>
<p>Some people have speculated that Trump’s casino addiction is a sign of a larger problem. They say that Trump may have some sort of mental health issue that causes him to compulsively gamble. Others argue that Trump’s addiction is simply a result of his greed and lack of self-control.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reasons behind Trump’s casino addiction, it is clear that it is a serious problem. Gambling can be very addictive and can ruin people’s lives. Trump should seek help for this addiction if he wants to avoid any further damage to his career or reputation.</p>

        <h1 id="When-has-gambling-legalized-in-Nevada"><a href="#When-has-gambling-legalized-in-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="When has gambling legalized in Nevada?"></a>When has gambling legalized in Nevada?</h1><p>Gambling has been legalized in Nevada since 1931 when the state’s voters passed a constitutional amendment to allow casino gambling. This made Nevada the first U.S. state to legalize casino gambling.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-legalizing-gambling-in-Nevada"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-legalizing-gambling-in-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of legalizing gambling in Nevada?"></a>What are the benefits of legalizing gambling in Nevada?</h1><p>There are a number of benefits that would come along with legalizing gambling in Nevada. First, it would generate much-needed revenue for the state. This money could be used to fund education, infrastructure improvements, and other important government programs.</p>
<p>Second, legalizing gambling would create jobs. The tourism industry in Nevada is already booming, and legalizing gambling would only help to further grow this sector. Jobs in the casino industry are high-paying, and they would provide a much-needed boost to the state’s economy.</p>
<p>Third, legalizing gambling would attract more tourists to Nevada. People who enjoy gambling would flock to the state, as it would be one of the only places in the country where it is legal to do so. This would result in an increase in tourism dollars and help to support the state’s economy.</p>
<p>Finally, legalizing gambling would bring much-needed regulation to the industry. Currently, there is no oversight of casino operations in Nevada. This can lead to unethical practices by gaming establishments. By legalizing gambling, the state could put in place rules and regulations that would protect consumers and ensure that casinos are operated fairly.</p>
<h1 id="What-does-legalized-gambling-mean-for-Nevada"><a href="#What-does-legalized-gambling-mean-for-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="What does legalized gambling mean for Nevada?"></a>What does legalized gambling mean for Nevada?</h1><p>The legalization of gambling in Nevada means that gambling is no longer illegal in the state. Gambling has been around in Nevada for centuries, and was legalized in 1931. There are now over 1,000 legal gambling establishments in Nevada, making it the gambling capital of the world.</p>
<p>Legalized gambling has been a big boon to the state of Nevada. In 2015, gambling generated over $9.8 billion in revenue for the state, and accounted for over 14% of the state’s total revenue. This money pays for essential services such as education and public safety.</p>
<p>Legalized gambling has also created jobs in Nevada. There are now over 100,000 people employed in the casino industry in Nevada, and this number continues to grow. Gambling also supports other businesses such as restaurants, hotels, and transportation companies.</p>
<p>There are some who oppose legalized gambling, however. They argue that it is a vice that leads to addiction and financial ruin. They also argue that it causes crime and social problems. But studies have shown that legalized gambling is actually good for the economy and creates jobs. It is also not as addictive as some people think it is.</p>
<p>Overall, legalized gambling has been good for Nevada. It has generated billions of dollars in revenue and created thousands of jobs. It has also been a source of entertainment for Nevadans for generations.</p>
<h1 id="How-will-legalized-gambling-impact-Nevada’s-economy"><a href="#How-will-legalized-gambling-impact-Nevada’s-economy" class="headerlink" title="How will legalized gambling impact Nevada’s economy?"></a>How will legalized gambling impact Nevada’s economy?</h1><p>The legalization of gambling in Nevada has had a significant impact on the state’s economy. Gambling revenues account for a large portion of Nevada’s state budget and support many important government services.</p>
<p>The legalization of gambling in Nevada began in 1931 when the state legalized craps and roulette. In 1945, the state legalized blackjack. The biggest leap in legalized gambling came in 1969 when poker was legalized. Casino gambling was legalized in 1978.</p>
<p>According to a study by the University of Nevada, Reno, the legalization of gambling has resulted in a total economic benefit to the state of $37 billion since 1931. This includes $9.7 billion in direct impacts such as casino jobs and wages, tax revenue and tourism spending, and $27.3 billion in indirect impacts such as supplier jobs and wages, and spending by people employed in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Gambling is a major source of revenue for the state of Nevada. In fiscal year 2018, gambling generated over $1.3 billion in taxes for the state government. This accounted for 9% of total tax revenue collected by the state. Gambling also supported over 26,000 jobs with wages and benefits totaling over $1 billion.</p>
<p>The legalization of gambling has also been a boon to tourism in Nevada. In 2017, over 42 million people visited Las Vegas alone, generating $60 billion in visitor spending. This accounts for over one-third of all tourism spending in Nevada and makes Las Vegas one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world.</p>
<p>The legalization of gambling has been an important component of Nevada’s economy for over 80 years. Gambling revenues provide much-needed funding for government services and support thousands of jobs throughout the state.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-implications-of-legalizing-gambling-in-Nevada"><a href="#What-are-the-implications-of-legalizing-gambling-in-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="What are the implications of legalizing gambling in Nevada?"></a>What are the implications of legalizing gambling in Nevada?</h1><p>The legalization of gambling in Nevada has had a variety of implications on the state, its residents, and its visitors. Some of the most notable effects include increased tourism and revenue, as well as the ability to regulate gambling and prevent criminal activity.</p>
<p>When Nevada legalized gambling in 1931, it became the first place in the United States to do so. The state saw an immediate increase in tourism, as people came from all over to try their luck at the casinos. In fact, gambling has been such a big draw for tourists that Nevada is now known as the “gaming capital of the world.”</p>
<p>In addition to boosting tourism, gambling has also been a major source of revenue for Nevada. In 2017, for example, casinos in the state generated more than $11 billion in gaming revenue. This money goes towards supporting important state programs and services, such as education and healthcare.</p>
<p>Another benefit of legalizing gambling is that it allows for better regulation of the industry. This is important because it helps protect consumers from dishonest operators and prevents criminal activity such as money laundering.</p>
<p>Overall, the legalization of gambling in Nevada has been a great success. It has boosted tourism and revenue while also providing a safe and regulated environment for players.</p>

        <h1 id="How-to-Get-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Casino-Complaints"><a href="#How-to-Get-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Casino-Complaints" class="headerlink" title="How to Get the Most Out of Your Casino Complaints"></a>How to Get the Most Out of Your Casino Complaints</h1><p>If you’re anything like most casino players, you’re probably eager to get the most out of your complaints. It can be frustrating when things don’t go your way, but with a little bit of preparation and know-how, you can make sure that your complaints are heard and dealt with in the best possible way. In this article, we’ll provide some tips on how to make the most of your casino complaints.</p>
<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that it’s important to be polite and respectful when making a complaint. Nobody wants to deal with someone who’s angry and hostile, so always remember to stay calm and courteous. This will not only put the casino staff at ease, but it will also show that you’re serious about resolving the issue.</p>
<p>When making a complaint, always be specific. Details are key, as they help the casino staff understand what went wrong and how they can fix it. Make sure to list all relevant information, such as dates, times, and game IDs. If you have any evidence (e.g., screenshots or videos), be sure to include that as well.</p>
<p>It’s also important to keep in mind that casinos are businesses, and as such, they often have policies in place regarding complaints. Be sure to familiarize yourself with these policies before making a complaint; this will help ensure that your issue is addressed in a timely and effective manner.</p>
<p>Finally, always follow up on your complaints. If you don’t hear back from the casino after initiating a complaint, reach out again via email or telephone. This shows that you’re serious about getting the issue resolved and that you’re not going to let it drop.</p>
<p>By following these tips, you can make sure that your casino complaints are taken seriously and dealt with in a timely and effective manner.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Complain-About-a-Casino-Without-Looking-Like-a-Jerk"><a href="#How-to-Complain-About-a-Casino-Without-Looking-Like-a-Jerk" class="headerlink" title="How to Complain About a Casino Without Looking Like a Jerk"></a>How to Complain About a Casino Without Looking Like a Jerk</h1><p>The last thing you want to do when you have a complaint about a casino is come across as a jerk. The goal is to get your issue resolved in a way that’s fair for you and the casino, and it can be difficult to do that if you’re acting like a diva. However, there are ways to make your complaint without alienating the casino staff or looking like a crybaby.</p>
<p>The first step is to always be polite. Casinos are businesses, and the people who work there are trying to make a living just like everyone else. Address them by their titles (Mr., Mrs., Miss, etc.), and use please and thank you. Even if you feel like the person on the other end of the phone doesn’t deserve it, manners never hurt.</p>
<p>The next step is to be specific about your complaint. Rather than saying “the casino was terrible,” give details about what happened. This will help the staff understand what went wrong and how they can fix it. If you had a bad experience at one of the tables, for example, tell them which table it was and what game you were playing. If you’re unhappy with your slot machine, explain which one it was and what happened.</p>
<p>Finally, stay calm and be patient. The person on the other end of the phone may not be able to solve your problem immediately, but they will do their best to help resolve it as soon as possible. Casino complaints can be frustrating, but remember that taking the high road is more likely to get you what you want in the end.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Complain-to-a-Casino-and-Actually-Get-Results"><a href="#How-to-Complain-to-a-Casino-and-Actually-Get-Results" class="headerlink" title="How to Complain to a Casino and Actually Get Results"></a>How to Complain to a Casino and Actually Get Results</h1><p>When it comes to casinos, the phrase “the house always wins” is something of an understatement. Casinos make billions of dollars each year, in large part because they are very good at discouraging customers from lodging complaints. However, if you know how to complain to a casino and where to direct your grievances, you can get results.</p>
<p>The first step is to find the right person to complain to. In most cases, this will be either a customer service representative or a manager. It is important that you are polite and respectful when lodging your complaint. Otherwise, the casino may be less likely to take your concerns seriously.</p>
<p>Be specific when describing what happened. If you lost money because of a technical issue with the games or the casino’s software, for example, provide as much detail as possible. Make sure to include the date and time of the incident, as well as any contact information you may have for other witnesses.</p>
<p>If you are unhappy with the response you receive from customer service, don’t be afraid to escalate your complaint. Many casinos have a formal process for doing this. You can find contact information for the appropriate authority on the casino’s website or by calling customer service directly.</p>
<p>Complaining to a casino can be frustrating, but it is often worth it if you want to get results. By following these tips, you can make sure your voice is heard and that your concerns are addressed.</p>
<h1 id="How-Casinos-Deal-with-Complaints"><a href="#How-Casinos-Deal-with-Complaints" class="headerlink" title="How Casinos Deal with Complaints"></a>How Casinos Deal with Complaints</h1><p>If you’ve ever been to a casino, you know that they are some of the most tightly run businesses around. From the moment you walk in, there are employees everywhere keeping an eye on everything. This level of organization and attention to detail is necessary to ensure the safety of both the guests and the casino’s assets.</p>
<p>In addition to safety and security, casinos also have to worry about customer service. Any complaints or problems that arise need to be dealt with quickly and efficiently. Casino employees are often trained in how to handle these situations.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways that casinos deal with customer complaints. One way is through the use of customer service representatives. These employees are responsible for handling customer inquiries and complaints. They can offer help with things like resolving issues with a particular game or redeeming comps.</p>
<p>Another way casinos deal with complaints is through the use of complaint forms. These forms allow guests to report any problems they have had while at the casino. This can include anything from getting lost or having trouble cashing out their winnings to feeling harassed or threatened by another guest.</p>
<p>The third way casinos deal with complaints is by using online forums. This allows guests to voice their concerns and suggestions directly to the casino management team. It also allows them to read about other people’s experiences at the casino. This can be helpful in deciding whether or not to visit a particular casino.</p>
<p>No matter which method casinos use, the goal is always the same: to resolve the complaint as quickly and satisfactorily as possible for the guest involved.</p>

Here are a few tips on how to keep your complaints from getting lost in the shuffle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure to speak to a supervisor.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have a complaint, it’s important to speak to a supervisor as soon as possible. This way, you can ensure that your complaint is properly documented and that you get a response from the casino.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Keep track of who you spoke to and what was said.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s also important to keep track of who you spoke to and what was said during your conversation. This will help ensure that there is a clear record of your complaint and that the casino can’t deny having received it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Follow up with the casino.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, be sure to follow up with the casino after making your complaint. This will help ensure that your issue is taken care of and that you get a response from the casino.</p>

<p>Red River’s star player, RJ Hampton, lead all scorers with an impressive 34 points. His teammate and fellow freshman standout Isaiah Joe also had a big game, totaling 22 points of his own. Hampton and Joe’s backcourt play was the difference in the game, as they took turns driving to the hoop and either finishing or finding open teammates for easy baskets.</p>
<p>Eastland’s offense was led by senior guard Jalen Washington, who finished with 23 points. However, no other player on Eastland was able to break into double figures. This lack of scoring depth doomed the Golden Yangs, as they were unable to keep up with Red River’s potent attack.</p>
<p>Red River will look to continue their winning ways when they take on the Arlington Seagulls later this week. Eastland will hope to rebound when they face off against the Crowley Eagles later in the week.</p>

Another advantage to playing casino games online is that many of them can be played for free in order to practice or learn the game before playing for real money.</p>
<p>One popular online casino game is called Dragon Tiger. This game is a version of blackjack, but with a few twists that make it more interesting. The basic premise is still to draw cards until you reach 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over, but in Dragon Tiger players also have the opportunity to bet on which of two tigers will win a fight. This can add an element of excitement to the game and make it more strategic.</p>
<p>While gambling can be enjoyable, it’s important to remember that it’s also important to gamble responsibly. Gambling should not be viewed as a way to make money, but rather as a form of entertainment. If you find yourself spending too much time or money on gambling, it might be time to take a break or stop altogether.</p>

        <h1 id="Investigators-believe-organized-crime-was-behind-the-Trump-casino-fire"><a href="#Investigators-believe-organized-crime-was-behind-the-Trump-casino-fire" class="headerlink" title="Investigators believe organized crime was behind the Trump casino fire"></a>Investigators believe organized crime was behind the Trump casino fire</h1><p>Almost exactly four years after the Trump Taj Mahal casino caught fire, investigators believe that organized crime was behind the blaze. The official story is that a welder’s torch ignited linseed oil fumes in a paint shop and the ensuing inferno caused $1 billion in damage, but many people don’t believe that story.</p>
<p>The suspicion is that the mob set the fire to clear the way for their own casino, the Atlantic City Hilton, which would go on to become one of the most successful gambling establishments in town. Some even allege that Trump himself was complicit in the scheme, although there’s no hard evidence to support that claim.</p>
<p>Whatever the truth may be, the Trump Taj Mahal fire is still remembered as one of the worst disasters in Atlantic City history.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-casino-blaze-could-have-been-started-deliberately"><a href="#Trump-casino-blaze-could-have-been-started-deliberately" class="headerlink" title="Trump casino blaze could have been started deliberately"></a>Trump casino blaze could have been started deliberately</h1><p>The infamous Trump casino blaze in Atlantic City could have been started deliberately, according to a new report.</p>
<p>The blaze, which took place in 1990, killed three people and injured 50 others. It was the biggest fire in Atlantic City’s history at the time.</p>
<p>Now, a team of independent investigators has said that the fire could have been started deliberately. They said that there was evidence of “carefully planned ignition”, and that it may not have been an accident after all.</p>
<p>The investigators said that the blaze began in a section of the casino that was being renovated at the time. They said that there were no accidental causes for the fire, and that it must have been started deliberately.</p>
<p> Trump has always denied any wrongdoing in connection with the blaze, and has previously dismissed the allegations as “lies” and “nonsense”.</p>
<p>But now there is fresh evidence to suggest that he may have been involved in starting the fire deliberately. The new report is likely to reignite calls for a full investigation into what happened on that fateful night.</p>
<h1 id="5-million-in-damages-as-Trump-casino-destroyed-by-fire"><a href="#5-million-in-damages-as-Trump-casino-destroyed-by-fire" class="headerlink" title="$5 million in damages as Trump casino destroyed by fire"></a>$5 million in damages as Trump casino destroyed by fire</h1><p>The early morning hours of March 21st were filled with chaos and commotion as a massive fire destroyed the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. The blaze, which started on the 2nd floor of the casino and quickly spread, resulted in over $5 million in damages and left nearly 100 employees without jobs.</p>
<p>While the cause of the fire is still unknown, officials believe that it may have been sparked by a faulty electrical outlet. This isn’t the first time that the Trump Taj Mahal has had issues with fires – back in 1990, another blaze caused over $3 million in damages.</p>
<p>Ironically, this most recent disaster comes just a few months after billionaire investor Carl Icahn shut down the casino due to its financial troubles. At the time of its closure, more than 3,000 employees were laid off.</p>
<p>In a statement released following the fire, Icahn said that he was “saddened by the events at the Taj Mahal but thankful that there were no injuries or loss of life”. He went on to say that he was committed to helping those affected find new jobs.</p>
<p>For many in Atlantic City, the Trump Taj Mahal was more than just a place to gamble – it was an institution. And now, after yet another disaster, it looks like it may be gone for good.</p>
<h1 id="Arson-suspected-in-Trump-casino-fire"><a href="#Arson-suspected-in-Trump-casino-fire" class="headerlink" title="Arson suspected in Trump casino fire"></a>Arson suspected in Trump casino fire</h1><p>Investigators believe that someone intentionally set fire to the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City early Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The blaze caused significant damage to the casino, and officials say it will likely be closed for months as they repair the damage.</p>
<p>No injuries were reported in the fire, but it is unclear what – if any – evidence has been found so far linking it to a possible arson attack on the casino.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, who originally built and owned the casino, released a statement saying that he was “saddened by the disastrous fire” and offering his support to the investigators.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Trump’s businesses have been targeted by arsonists – both his golf courses and hotels have also been hit in recent years.</p>
<h1 id="Investigation-underway-as-Trump-casino-destroyed-by-fire"><a href="#Investigation-underway-as-Trump-casino-destroyed-by-fire" class="headerlink" title="Investigation underway as Trump casino destroyed by fire"></a>Investigation underway as Trump casino destroyed by fire</h1><p>One of the Trump casinos in Atlantic City was destroyed by a raging fire on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Workers were still inside the casino when the fire started, and according to witnesses, they were screaming for help as the flames quickly engulfed the building.</p>
<p>Firefighters arrived on the scene within minutes, but were unable to save the casino. The exact cause of the fire is still under investigation, but officials believe it may have been started by a faulty light fixture.</p>
<p>This is not the first time one of Trump’s businesses has gone up in flames - his New York City casino also caught fire in 1991.</p>
<p> Trump has yet to make a statement about the latest disaster, but we can only hope that he will be able to rebuild this casino and create some jobs for the thousands of people who have lost theirs.</p>
