#  Belmont Stakes winner wins again while betting on Zalgiris

Belmont Stakes winner Justify won the Belmont Stakes for the second time in a row on Saturday. The horse, who was also the betting favorite, is now 13 for 13 in his career. He had previously won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.

Justify's trainer, Bob Baffert, was naturally very pleased with the horse's win. "He showed he's a champion," said Baffert after the race. "He just keeps winning."

Interestingly, while Justify was cruising to victory at the Belmont Stakes, his ownership group was also winning big on EuroLeague basketball team Zalgiris Kaunas. Justify's ownership group, WinStar Farm LLC, had placed a $1 million bet on Zalgiris to win their semifinal game against CSKA Moscow earlier in the week. Sure enough, Zalgiris pulled off the upset victory and WinStar reaped a cool $1.4 million profit from their bet.

"I told them it would be my lucky day," joked WinStar president Elliott Walden after Justify's Belmont victory.

Baffert himself is no stranger to betting on sports either. In fact, he has admitted to having lost as much as $7 million over his career gambling on horses and other sporting events. But with earnings of over $100 million from training racehorses alone, Baffert can certainly afford to take some losses here and there.

#  Mayweather backers continue to cash betting on Zalgiris

Lithuania’s Zalgiris opened as a +275 underdog against undefeated boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr., but Las Vegas sportsbooks say the majority of money wagered on the game is still coming in on the unbeaten fighter.

Zalgiris stunned Saratov, Russia, last week to earn a spot in the Euroleague playoffs, but it will be a heavy underdog against Mayweather when the two meet Saturday night in Las Vegas.

“Mayweather is a huge favorite and will probably win by knockout, but there’s still some money being bet on Zalgiris,” said John Avello, director of race and sports at the Wynn Las Vegas casino.

According to oddsmakers at the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas, Mayweather is currently a -4000 favorite, meaning a $400 bet would yield just $10 in profit if he wins. Zalgiris is a +2700 underdog, meaning a $100 bet would return $2,700.

But while most of the action is on Mayweather, sportsbooks say there’s still some money coming in on Zalgiris.

“The majority of bets we’ve taken are on Mayweather, but not by as big of a margin as you might think,” said Jay Kornegay, vice president of race and sports at The Stratosphere hotel-casino in Las Vegas. “There’s still about 25-30 percent of our handle that has come in on Zalgiris.”

#  Zalgiris finally pays off for sports betting fans

For Lithuanian basketball fans, Thursday was a great day.

First, their team, Zalgiris Kaunas, finally won a game in this year’s Euroleague tournament, defeating Spanish club Unicaja Malaga 82-64. This was huge for the team, which was 0-5 going into the game.

But then things got even better. After Zalgiris’ victory was announced, its odds to win the whole tournament suddenly skyrocketed from 500-1 to 125-1 at one sports betting site.

This means that if you had put €10 on Zalgiris to win the Euroleague back in early October, you would now be €125 richer.

So for basketball fans in Lithuania – and all over Europe – Thursday was a very good day indeed.

#  Bettors pile up the profits betting on Zalgiris

Kaunas, Lithuania - Bettors from around the world have been piling up profits betting on Zalgiris Kaunas of the Lithuanian Basketball League (LBL) this season.

Zalgiris is one of the most successful teams in the LBL with six championships, seventeen Lithuanian Cups and nine Baltic Cups. This season, they are currently in first place in the LBL standings with an impressive record of 16-3.

Bettors have been taking advantage of the team’s success by betting on them to win games at very good odds. For example, before their game against Lietkabelis Panevezys on January 12th, the odds of Zalgiris winning were 1.72 at most sportsbooks. Bettors who placed a bet on Zalgiris to win would have profited even if they only won by 2 points or less as the odds were very good.

This strategy has been working well for bettors as Zalgiris has been winning a lot of their games by small margins. In their last five games, they have won by an average margin of 5.4 points. Bettors who placed bets on them in each of these games would have made a profit.

Overall, Zalgiris is a very strong team that is playing well this season. Bettors who are looking to make some profits should consider betting on them to win their upcoming games.

#  NBA Finals prop bet pays off big betting on Zalgiris

The Golden State Warriors were big favorites to win the NBA Finals against the upstart Zalgiris squad from Lithuania. But as the series unfolded, it was clear that Zalgiris had no intention of just rolling over and playing dead. The Lithuanians put up a strong fight in each game, and even managed to take one victory away from the mighty Warriors.

But in the end, it was Golden State who triumphed, and they did so in impressive fashion. They won the last three games of the series by an average margin of more than 20 points per game. This dominant performance has many basketball fans wondering if the Warriors are actually contenders for the title this year.

And while it's still too early to say for sure, there's no doubt that this Golden State squad is absolutely loaded with talent. Led by Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, they have one of the most potent offensive attacks in all of basketball. And on defense, they're anchored by rim protector Draymond Green, who is arguably one of the best defenders in the league.

All of this talent has resulted in some impressively large point spreads for Golden State games this season. In fact, their average point spread for this year's playoffs is a whopping 16 points! That means that if you bet on them to win every game by at least 16 points, you would be 21-3 on your bets so far!

Clearly, Golden State is a powerhouse team that should not be underestimated. So if you're looking for a high-confidence bet with excellent potential returns, betting on them to cover big point spreads is definitely a move worth considering.
