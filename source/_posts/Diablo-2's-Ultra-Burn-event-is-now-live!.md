#  Diablo 2's Ultra Burn event is now live!

The Diablo 2 servers are now live with the Ultra Burn event! This event is a Timed gauntlet where players race to see who can kill the most enemies in the shortest amount of time. The top player on each server will receive a prize, and we’ll be giving out some other prizes to randomly selected participants.

To participate, just join any public game channel and type /ultraburn into the chat. You’ll be given a short timer, and then you can start killing enemies! The timer will start ticking down when you first hit an enemy, so make sure to hurry!

#  Get a chance to win a Druid helm by participating in Ultra Burn!

Druids looking for a chance to win an Ultra Burn Druid helm are in luck! By participating in the event, they can not only gain a chance at the prize, but also help support the Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.

Starting on September 1 and running through the end of the month, players can join in on the fun by gathering ultra Burns. These rare items can be obtained by participating in various events throughout the game, including dungeons, raids and battlegrounds. The more ultra Burns players gather, the greater their chances of winning the helmet will be. In addition, 100% of all donations collected from players during the event will be given to support CMN Hospitals.

This is a great opportunity for druids to get some extra loot and help a good cause at the same time. Be sure to participate in Ultra Burn between September 1 and September 30 for your chance to win!
