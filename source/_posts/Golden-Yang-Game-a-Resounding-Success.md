#  Red River Casino Routs Eastland Golden Yang Game

The Red River Casino outplayed the Eastland Golden Yangs in their matchup yesterday evening, racking up a convincing 106-86 victory.

Red River’s star player, RJ Hampton, lead all scorers with an impressive 34 points. His teammate and fellow freshman standout Isaiah Joe also had a big game, totaling 22 points of his own. Hampton and Joe’s backcourt play was the difference in the game, as they took turns driving to the hoop and either finishing or finding open teammates for easy baskets.

Eastland’s offense was led by senior guard Jalen Washington, who finished with 23 points. However, no other player on Eastland was able to break into double figures. This lack of scoring depth doomed the Golden Yangs, as they were unable to keep up with Red River’s potent attack.

Red River will look to continue their winning ways when they take on the Arlington Seagulls later this week. Eastland will hope to rebound when they face off against the Crowley Eagles later in the week.
