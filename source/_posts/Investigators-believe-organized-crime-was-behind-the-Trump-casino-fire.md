#  Investigators believe organized crime was behind the Trump casino fire

Almost exactly four years after the Trump Taj Mahal casino caught fire, investigators believe that organized crime was behind the blaze. The official story is that a welder’s torch ignited linseed oil fumes in a paint shop and the ensuing inferno caused $1 billion in damage, but many people don’t believe that story.

The suspicion is that the mob set the fire to clear the way for their own casino, the Atlantic City Hilton, which would go on to become one of the most successful gambling establishments in town. Some even allege that Trump himself was complicit in the scheme, although there’s no hard evidence to support that claim.

Whatever the truth may be, the Trump Taj Mahal fire is still remembered as one of the worst disasters in Atlantic City history.

#  Trump casino blaze could have been started deliberately

The infamous Trump casino blaze in Atlantic City could have been started deliberately, according to a new report.

The blaze, which took place in 1990, killed three people and injured 50 others. It was the biggest fire in Atlantic City’s history at the time.

Now, a team of independent investigators has said that the fire could have been started deliberately. They said that there was evidence of “carefully planned ignition”, and that it may not have been an accident after all.

The investigators said that the blaze began in a section of the casino that was being renovated at the time. They said that there were no accidental causes for the fire, and that it must have been started deliberately.

 Trump has always denied any wrongdoing in connection with the blaze, and has previously dismissed the allegations as “lies” and “nonsense”.

But now there is fresh evidence to suggest that he may have been involved in starting the fire deliberately. The new report is likely to reignite calls for a full investigation into what happened on that fateful night.

#  $5 million in damages as Trump casino destroyed by fire

The early morning hours of March 21st were filled with chaos and commotion as a massive fire destroyed the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. The blaze, which started on the 2nd floor of the casino and quickly spread, resulted in over $5 million in damages and left nearly 100 employees without jobs.

While the cause of the fire is still unknown, officials believe that it may have been sparked by a faulty electrical outlet. This isn’t the first time that the Trump Taj Mahal has had issues with fires – back in 1990, another blaze caused over $3 million in damages.

Ironically, this most recent disaster comes just a few months after billionaire investor Carl Icahn shut down the casino due to its financial troubles. At the time of its closure, more than 3,000 employees were laid off.

In a statement released following the fire, Icahn said that he was “saddened by the events at the Taj Mahal but thankful that there were no injuries or loss of life”. He went on to say that he was committed to helping those affected find new jobs.

For many in Atlantic City, the Trump Taj Mahal was more than just a place to gamble – it was an institution. And now, after yet another disaster, it looks like it may be gone for good.

#  Arson suspected in Trump casino fire

Investigators believe that someone intentionally set fire to the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City early Wednesday morning.

The blaze caused significant damage to the casino, and officials say it will likely be closed for months as they repair the damage.

No injuries were reported in the fire, but it is unclear what – if any – evidence has been found so far linking it to a possible arson attack on the casino.

Donald Trump, who originally built and owned the casino, released a statement saying that he was "saddened by the disastrous fire" and offering his support to the investigators.

This is not the first time that Trump's businesses have been targeted by arsonists – both his golf courses and hotels have also been hit in recent years.

#  Investigation underway as Trump casino destroyed by fire

One of the Trump casinos in Atlantic City was destroyed by a raging fire on Wednesday night.

Workers were still inside the casino when the fire started, and according to witnesses, they were screaming for help as the flames quickly engulfed the building.

Firefighters arrived on the scene within minutes, but were unable to save the casino. The exact cause of the fire is still under investigation, but officials believe it may have been started by a faulty light fixture.

This is not the first time one of Trump's businesses has gone up in flames - his New York City casino also caught fire in 1991.

 Trump has yet to make a statement about the latest disaster, but we can only hope that he will be able to rebuild this casino and create some jobs for the thousands of people who have lost theirs.
