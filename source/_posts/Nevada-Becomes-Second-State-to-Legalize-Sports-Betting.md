#  Nevada Becomes Second State to Legalize Sports Betting

On Tuesday, the Nevada state legislature passed a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. If signed into law by Governor Brian Sandoval, Nevada would become the second state after Delaware to legalize sports betting.

"It is time for Nevada to join other states in this new and exciting industry," said Assemblyman William Horne, the sponsor of the bill.

The legislation would allow casinos in Nevada to offer bets on professional and collegiate sporting events. It would also create a sports commission to regulate the industry. The commission would be responsible for licensing operators, setting minimum age requirements for bettors, and ensuring that games are fair and not manipulated by insiders.

The Nevada Gaming Commission has already expressed support for the bill, saying that it would provide an "additional form of entertainment" for casino patrons.

Nevada's move comes as several other states are considering similar measures. New Jersey has already drafted a bill that would legalize sports betting, and legislators in Illinois, Michigan, and California are considering similar proposals.

#  Delaware Joins Nevada in Legalizing Sports Betting

On June 5, 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down a 26-year old law that prohibited most states from authorizing sports betting. The court's ruling in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association opens the door for Delaware to join Nevada in allowing people to bet on professional and college sporting events.

Since the law was overturned, Delaware has been moving quickly to legalize sports betting. Governor John Carney is expected to sign a bill into law that would allow casinos and racetracks in the state to offer sports betting. The bill would also allow the state's three casinos to offer online gaming, including poker and casino games.

Supporters of legalized sports betting say that it will generate new revenue for the state and create jobs. They also argue that it will help keep gambling addiction in check by giving people a legal way to bet on sports.

Opponents of legalized sports betting say that it could lead to more gambling addiction and crime. They also argue that it could negatively impact sporting events by making them less fair and less safe.

It remains to be seen how much revenue Delaware will generate from legalized sports betting. However, other states are likely to follow its lead, which could mean big bucks for state governments across the country.

#  New Jersey Becomes Third State to Legalize Sports Betting

On Monday, June 11, 2018, New Jersey became the third state in the country to legalize sports betting. The state's governor, Phil Murphy, signed the bill into law just a few hours after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting.

"Today is an important day for our state and for the millions of people who love to gamble on sports," Murphy said at a signing ceremony at the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford. "I'm proud to say that now we can provide our residents and visitors with a safe and legal alternative to traveling to Las Vegas or other illegal gambling hubs."

The new law allows Atlantic City casinos and racetracks in New Jersey to offer sports betting. It also authorizes online sports betting, which will be available through New Jersey's existing internet gaming platforms.

The state is expected to begin taking bets within two weeks, but it remains unclear how much revenue the new industry will generate. Some experts estimate that New Jersey could earn up to $100 million annually from sports betting, but others believe that number could be much higher.

Governor Murphy has already allocated $30 million in revenue from sports betting to help fund education programs in New Jersey.

The legalization of sports betting is a major victory for Governor Murphy, who made it a key part of his campaign platform last year. In a statement released shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision was announced, Murphy said that he was "elated" by the news and vowed to work quickly to bring sports betting to New Jersey.



New Jersey is not the only state that is moving quickly to legalize sports betting following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on Monday. Delaware will begin taking bets later this week, and Mississippi plans to offer sports betting by the start of football season in September.

#  Pennsylvania Becomes Fourth State to Legalize Sports Betting

On Tuesday, May 15, 2018,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) the Pennsylvania Senate voted 43-7 in favor of legalizing sports betting within the state. The House of Representatives had voted earlier in the week by a 178-168 margin in favor of the measure. This makes Pennsylvania the fourth state to legalize sports betting since the landmark Supreme Court ruling on May 14 that struck down a 1992 federal law banning most sports betting. Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey were the first states to offer legalized sports betting following the ruling.

The new Pennsylvania law allows for both online and in-person sports betting at casinos, racetracks, and other approved venues. Bettors will be able to place wagers on professional and college sporting events, although some restrictions will apply to bets placed on high school sporting events. The measure sets up a regulatory framework for sports betting in Pennsylvania, including licensing fees and taxes on gambling operators. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board will have authority to oversee and regulate sports betting in the state.

The passage of this legislation means that there are now four states where it is legal to place a bet on a sporting event. This is in addition to numerous other countries where sports betting is already legal. With more states likely to legalize sports betting in the coming months and years, it appears that the days of the prohibition against sports gambling may be coming to an end.

#  West Virginia Becomes Fifth State to Legalize Sports Betting

West Virginia became the fifth state in the US to legalize sports betting on Monday, following the lead of Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi and Pennsylvania.

The bill was signed into law by West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, who said it would create jobs and bring in new tax revenue. "This is about jobs. This is about economic development," Justice said at a press conference. "It's about putting money back into the pockets of our citizens."

West Virginia is one of six states that have introduced bills to legalize sports betting this year, though it is the only one so far to have passed one. The others are Michigan, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Virginia.

Sports betting is currently illegal in most states under the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992. However, PASPA was ruled unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court in May, opening the door for states to legalize it.

The American Gaming Association (AGA), a casino industry trade group, estimates that Americans illegally bet $150 billion on sports each year. They expect that number to grow to $240 billion once sports betting is legalized nationwide.

Legalizing sports betting could provide a major boost to state coffers. The AGA estimates that states could collect up to $20 billion in tax revenue annually from it.
