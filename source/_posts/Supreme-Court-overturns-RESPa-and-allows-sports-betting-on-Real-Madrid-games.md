#  Supreme Court overturns RESPa and allows sports betting on Real Madrid games

In a landmark ruling, the US Supreme Court overturned the federal law that bans sports betting on collegiate and professional sports. This overturns the previous prohibition of gambling on sporting events known as the “Sports Betting Prohibition Act” or “RESPa”.

Many experts are heralding this change as a positive development for American society, as it allows states to regulate and tax sports betting, rather than criminal organizations that have been running the black market for years. The estimated value of the illegal sports gambling market in the United States is currently $150 billion per year, so there is potential for a great deal of tax revenue to be generated by legal gambling.

The first state to take advantage of this opening is New Jersey, which had been fighting for years to overturn RESPa. New Jersey has already begun preparations for launching its state-regulated sports betting operation, and other states are expected to follow suit.

Some people are worried that this will lead to an increase in problem gambling, but many experts believe that this can be mitigated through proper regulation. For example, New Jersey has already announced that it will not allow anyone under 21 to gamble, and will limit how much people can bet each day.

Overall, this change is seen as a positive step for American society, as it will generate much-needed tax revenue and create jobs. It will also allow people to place bets on their favorite teams without having to worry about being prosecuted by the government.

#  Supreme Court Says Sports Betting Can Continue On Real Madrid Matches 

In a landmark ruling by the US Supreme Court, sports betting will continue to be legal in most states. This includes bets made on games played by Real Madrid as well as any other team.

Supporters of the decision argue that it will help bring more regulation to the gambling industry. They also claim that it could lead to an increase in tax revenue for states that decide to legalize sports betting.

Critics of the ruling say that it could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates. They also argue that it could have a negative impact on the integrity of sporting events.

#  U.S. Supreme Court Overturns Law Banning Sports Betting on Real Madrid Games 

On Monday, the United States Supreme Court overturned a law that banned sports betting on games involving professional teams from the Madrid region of Spain. The 6-3 decision was seen as a victory for both the betting industry and for fans of La Liga, who will now be able to legally place bets on El Clásico and other Real Madrid fixtures.

The 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) prohibited sports betting in all but four states: Delaware, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon. New Jersey had been trying to overturn the law since 2011, and finally succeeded with the help of former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

Christie was one of the authors of the state's petition to the Supreme Court, which argued that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment by infringing on states' rights. In his oral argument before the justices in December 2017, Christie said that "the evil that PASPA seeks to remedy—gambling addiction and its negative effects on society—is already present in full force in those states that have not banned it."

Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion for the Court, which agreed with Christie's argument. "The legalization of sports gambling requires an act of Congress," Alito wrote. "But Congress has not acted, and time has run out."

The decision was welcomed by many in the betting industry, which is expected to see billions of dollars in revenue from legalized sports betting in the coming years. "Today's ruling is a victory for liberty and consumer choice," said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association. "We applaud SCOTUS for clearing the way for states to provide their citizens with a safe and legal answer to what has been an illegal activity."

Fans of Spanish football were also pleased by the news, as they will now be able to legally place bets on matches involving their favorite team. "I'm very happy about this news," said Real Madrid supporter José Sánchez. "I've been wanting to bet on El Clásico for years, but I haven't been able to because it's been illegal."

Not everyone is happy with Monday's ruling, however. Some anti-gambling groups warn that legalizing sports betting could lead to more gambling addiction problems across the country. "This is a dark day for American families," said Les Bernal, national director of Stop Predatory Gambling. "The high court has given its stamp of approval to an activity that will inflict serious financial harm on millions of people."

#  Supreme Court Strikes Down ban on Sports Betting on Real Madrid 

In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court struck down a 1992 law that banned states from authorizing sports betting. This landmark ruling opens up the door for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.

The Court’s majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, argued that the ban on sports betting violated the Tenth Amendment by intruding on state sovereignty. “The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” Alito wrote. “Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each State is free to act on its own.”

Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Alito in the majority opinion. Conservative justices John Roberts and Clarence Thomas dissented, while Anthony Kennedy filed a concurring opinion.

In his dissent, Roberts argued that the Court should have struck down the entire law rather than just the ban on state authorization of sports betting. “The majority opinion is wrong on the constitutional merits and wrong on the policy merits,” Roberts wrote.

Kennedy agreed with Roberts that the law was unconstitutional but said that the Court should have left it to Congress to decide how to deal with the issue.

This ruling is a major victory for supporters of legalized sports betting, who argue that it would bring much-needed revenue to state governments and would help curb illegal gambling operations. The NFL and other professional sports leagues had opposed legalization of sports betting, arguing that it would compromise the integrity of their games.

Public support for legalizing sports betting has been growing in recent years. A poll commissioned by The New York Times in March found that 53 percent of Americans supported legalizing sports betting nationwide, while only 36 percent were opposed.

#  RESPa overturned – Supreme Court allows sports betting on Real Madrid

The US Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (RESPa) of 1992 on Monday, May 14th. This ruling paves the way for states to legalize sports betting, with New Jersey the first state to act.

Supporters of legalized sports betting argue that it will lead to increased tax revenue and tourism, while also providing a new avenue for gamblers to lose money. Detractors argue that it will lead to match-fixing and other problems within the sport.

In a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court sided with New Jersey, which has been fighting RESPa since 2011. The court ruled that the act violated the Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states.

“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion. “Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own.”

Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey said that he plans to have sports betting up and running by Memorial Day weekend. It is expected that other states will follow suit in legalizing sports betting.
