#  What are the Squeaky Blinders?

The Squeaky Blinders are a street gang from the fictional city of Birmingham in England. The gang was founded and led by Tommy Shelby, played by Cillian Murphy. The name of the gang comes from the squeaking noise made by their leather jackets when they move.

The Squeaky Blinders are first introduced in the show's second episode, which aired on September 25, 2013. In the episode, Tommy and his brother Arthur rob a liquor store, and then take shelter in a church. While there, they meet Father Hughes, who offers them a job with his gang, the Peaky Blinders.

The Peaky Blinders are a rival gang to the Shelbys. They are out for revenge after Tommy and Arthur killed several of their members in the previous episode. However, Father Hughes tells Tommy that he can have his own territory within Birmingham if he can take it from Alfie Solomons, a Jewish gangster who is currently aligned with the Peaky Blinders.

Tommy agrees to Father Hughes' offer and sets out to build his own criminal empire. He starts by recruiting some of his friends from the army into the Squeaky Blinders, including John Shelby (Tommy's cousin) and Michael Gray. He also begins dealing arms to the British Army during World War I, which makes him very wealthy.

The Squeaky Blinders become one of the most powerful gangs in Birmingham, and they quickly gain a reputation for being ruthless and violent. Tommy himself is known as a cold-hearted leader who is not afraid to kill anyone who gets in his way.
